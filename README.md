hw python module 3

The Languages usesd for this assignment were 100% Python and the packages imported were csv inorder to read csv files and os. 
I used the relative paths to be able to find the right location and read the csv data which are found in the resources folder.
Same thing was also done for the export of the Data which is found in the export.txt file in the analysis folder.
The analysis Folder in both PyBank and PyPoll hold the results from my analysis.
The main.py file holds the main script used to run for each analysis.
